Search repositories by categories with these topic keywords: computers, consoles, arcades, others, mister, demistify, sockit, mergefork

**Repositories with the 'mister' topic contain MiSTer cores ported to SoCkit board.**

Repositories with the 'mergefork' topic are just a mirror and need to be up-to-date with the upstream repository. If you see that the repo has commits behind just go to the "forked from" repo link and get the core from there.
